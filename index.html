<p>I am a software engineering professional based in San Francisco. I have a wealth of experience with software development and operations, and one of my specialties is AWS architecture and setup. I'm advertising my services as a consultant on designing, implementing, automating, improving and saving time and money with AWS. </p>

<p>I do not claim to know everything about AWS, but I do have access to many people who are highly knowledgeable. When I need advice or have questions I often speak with Amazon directly either via support or in-person at their AWS Loft in San Francisco. They have guided me and validated my general approach and specific deployments. </p>

<p>Review your infrastructure, cut down costs, validate security models, make recommendations on efficiency improvements, and most importantly, automate the heck out of everything. 
I am not seeking long-term employment doing AWS management. You should have everything automated anyway. I will help you get there. I am first and foremost a lazy engineer.</p>
