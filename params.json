  "body": "## @revmischa - Amazon Web Services Thought Lord\r\n\r\n### Who Am I?\r\nI am a software engineering professional based in San Francisco. I have a wealth of experience with software development and operations, and one of my specialties is AWS architecture and setup. I'm advertising my services as a consultant on designing, implementing, automating, improving and saving time and money with AWS. \r\n\r\n### What Have I Done?\r\n* Live-migrated a health-tech company's infrastructure from a traditional datacenter to a HIPAA-compliant, secure AWS environment.\r\n* Implemented functionality with EC2, S3, SNS, SQS, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudFront, ElasticCache, API Gateway, RDS PostgreSQL, Route53, CodeDeploy, IAM, IoT, SES.\r\n* Released a [command-line tool suite](https://github.com/revmischa/udo) named \"Unemployed DevOps\" for wrangling clusters with AutoScaling Groups and CodeDeploy.\r\n* Presented a [talk on AWS](https://github.com/revmischa/lazyaws).\r\n* Designed monitoring and alerting systems based around CloudWatch\r\n* Reduced costs by eliminating wasteful services, using AutoScaling, removing special snowflake instances, optimizing request flow and server load to take full advantage of EC2 instances.\r\n* Massively streamlined deployments with AWS-native CodeDeploy.\r\n* Reduced web application server load and optimized static file delivery with nginx and CloudFront CDN.\r\n* Created highly available web application services and RDS multi-AZ database failover.\r\n\r\n### Do I Know What I'm Doing?\r\nI do not claim to know everything about AWS, but I do have access to many people who are highly knowledgeable. When I need advice or have questions I often speak with Amazon directly either via support or in-person at their AWS Loft in San Francisco. They have guided me and validated my general approach and specific deployments. \r\n\r\n### What Can I Do For You?\r\nReview your infrastructure, cut down costs, validate security models, make recommendations on efficiency improvements, and most importantly, automate the heck out of everything. \r\nI am not seeking long-term employment doing AWS management. You should have everything automated anyway. I will help you get there. I am first and foremost a lazy engineer.\r\n\r\n### Sounds Interesting, Now What?\r\nShoot me an email and we can chat and see if I can help you out. If I can't, no problemo.\r\n",
